I've created the class User and tested overridden equals() and hashCode() methods.

So for equals() method I created the following class files:
- Positive Test Cases (testUserEqualsPositive.class)
- Negative Test Cases (testUserEqualsNegative.class)
- put these Test Cases to Test Suite (testSuitUserEquals.class)
- run Test Suite from TestRunner (UserTestRunner.class)

For hashCode() method I created the following Test Case:
- testUserHashCode()
- run it from TestRunner (UserTestRunner.class)
